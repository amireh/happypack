# HappyPack Changelog

## 5.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Minimum supported version of node is now 6.11.5

### Features

- Added support for webpack 4
- New option `use`
- New option `loaders`

## 5.0.0-beta.4

- The `use` option now works FRD. Who thought renaming variables would be so
  hard? Refs GH-225, thanks to @inoyakaigor

## 5.0.0-beta.3

- The `rules` option that was introduced in 5.0.0-beta.1 was meant to be named
  `use` and has thus been renamed. Sorry about the confusion!

## 5.0.0-beta.2

- Fixed deprecation notice introduced by webpack 4 re `compiler.plugin`. Thanks
  to @log2-hwan, refs GH-218.

## 5.0.0-beta.1

- Added support for webpack4 resolving APIs, thanks to @marcokam. Refs GH-215
- HappyPlugin now accepts `rules` along with `loaders` for the loader list so
  that it's consistent with webpack notation.
  
### Breaking changes

- Minimum supported version of node has been upped to v6.11.5 to match
  webpack's.

## 4.0.1

Maintenance release for stripping down the built package to include only
the source files and to exclude transient/development-specific files. Refs
GH-205, thanks to @filipesilva.

## 4.0.0

Breaking release with two primary changes:

First, this release contains a fix for a long-standing issue on Windows
systems where the worker processes would hang indefinitely.

Second, the caching functionality has been removed[1]. Users relying on the
caching functionality may want to consider using the dedicated
[cache-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/cache-loader) but please
keep in mind that this is not officially supported or endorsed by HappyPack
and is not guaranteed to work (as is the case with other loaders.)

[1] See [this thread](https://github.com/amireh/happypack/issues/154#issuecomment-305627697)
    for more context about the caching change.

## 4.0.0-beta.5

- Support for webpack{2,3} loader context API `this.getDependencies`
- Support for webpack{2,3} loader context API `this.getContextDependencies`
- Now interoperable with `cache-loader`

## 4.0.0-beta.4

- Default to buffered messaging mode when using standalone thread pools on
  Windows.

## 4.0.0-beta.3

Fixed bug around the use of `process.send()` that was causing a hang on
Windows with sufficiently large number of modules (and message length.)

The following parse (on Linux) shows the penalty in buffered vs non-buffered
modes and implementations:

elapsed (ms) | buffering | mean (ms) | penalty (ms)

## 4.0.0-beta.2

- Errors are now property serialized in `emitWarning` and `emitError` loader
  APIs. Refs GH-161
- Deprecation upgrade: now using `loaderUtils.getOptions` instead of
  `.parseQuery`, refs GH-140

## 4.0.0-beta.1

- Support for file-system caching has been dropped. Use [cache-
  loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/cache-loader) if you're after this
  functionality.
- In the light of the caching change, the following options have lost their
  meaning and instead wish you a very happy life. Please note that as of this
  version configuring them will cause a warning to be logged to the console
  while in the future they will cause an exception to be thrown:
  - `tempDir`
  - `cache`
  - `cachePath`
  - `cacheContext`
  - `cacheSignatureGenerator`
- The `enabled` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  version. As disabling the plugin already requires the user to modify their
  config (e.g. to adjust the loader listings) this option had very little
  value.

## 3.1.0

- Fixed an edge race condition re cache signatures. Thanks to @saifelse, refs GH-159
- Now propagating loader errors correctly to webpack from background processes. Thanks to @zinserjan, refs GH-14
- Now exposing "minimize" to loader contexts. Thanks to @adventure-yunfei, refs GH-139

## 3.0.3

- Added more webpack2 compatibility fixes
- Fixed an issue that was causing cached files to be ignored. Thanks to
  @lijianzhang, refs GH-115

## 3.0.2

- Accept "this.plugins" as a function in the loader context since webpack2
  now allows it to either be an object or a function. Thanks to @grigory51,
  refs GH-106

## 3.0.1

- The temporary file path used for writing a loader's output is now suffixed
  with a random identifier to work around an edge case reported in GH-92. 
  Big thanks to @frankLife for the effort.

## 3.0.0

This release, although it's a major one, was mostly concerned with internal
changes and improvements to how the plugin worked. Most side-effects and global
state has been eliminated, which should hopefully result in fewer surprises 
when attempting to use HappyPack in a multi-build webpack setting.

- HappyPack will no longer output anything to the console if webpack is running
 in profiling mode (`--profile`) in order not to corrupt any JSON output. You 
 can restore the previous behavior by setting the new option 
 `verboseWhenProfiling` to `true`. Refs GH-76
- [BREAKING] Inferring loaders for configuration is no longer supported! If you
  were supplying { happy: { id: 'something' } } to your webpack loader configuration
  so that HappyPack picks it up, you need to rewrite that part of the config
  as is shown in the README.
- [POTENATIALLY BREAKING] HappyPlugin will no longer attempt to generate an 
  incremental ID to use if none is passed. Instead, it will simply default to
  `'1'` for an id in case it was not overridden by the user. This behavior 
  never actually provided any benefit since if you had multiple plugins 
  referenced by multiple loaders, you still had to provide each loader with a 
  distinct id (the loaders never incremented such a counter or relied on it.) 
  This solves GH-88. 
- Thread pools can now be shared across multiple compilers/builds! The plugin 
  and thread pools will correctly map each compiler to its configuration and 
  instruct the workers to use the correct configuration when they do their 
  work. Refs GH-82 and GH-72.
 
**Internal refactors**

- `HappyPlugin` and `HappyLoader` no longer deal with the RPCHandler to 
register active compiler or loader instances. Instead, this book-keeping is done implicitly by the _thread pools_ (which own the RPC handlers) when they are started, requested to compile, or stopped.
- The internal API `HappyPlugin.resetUID` has been dropped
- The internal API `HappyPlugin.isVerbose` is now hidden
- The internal API `HappyPlugin.isDebug` is now hidden
- The internal API `HappyPlugin.prototype.compileInBackground` is now hidden
- The internal API `HappyPlugin.prototype.compileInForeground` is now hidden
- The internal API `HappyPlugin.prototype._performCompilationRequest` is now hidden
- The internal API `HappyThreadPool.get` has been dropped. Instead, the thread pool exposes a `compile` API similar to the Thread's.
- The internal API `HappyThreadPool.getRPCHandler` has been dropped

## 2.2.1

- Fixed an edge-case issue that was causing happypack to crash when a shared 
  threadpool is used by a pre-loader and a loader (or post-loader) that are 
  processing the same file. Refs GH-60
- Made it possible to completely silence happypack's console output by setting
  verbose to `false` and introduced the `debug` option to control diagnostic
  message logging. Refs GH-64

## 2.2.0

- Fixed a regression in scanning loader "string chains" (multiple loaders 
  specified in the same string separated by `!`), refs GH-68
- Added support for the loader API `this.loadModule()` which is used by
  less-loader, refs GH-66

## 2.1.3

- Fixed an issue where certain loader configurations with queries weren't being
  properly recognized by HappyPack. Now, all known configuration variants 
  should work. (GH-65 and GH-26)

## 2.1.2

- Process argv will no longer be passed to the child processes spawned by 
  HappyPack (refs GH-47)
- Support for the `target` loader context variable has been added. Thanks to 
  @Akkuma (refs GH-46)

## 2.1.1

- Fixed an issue where happypack would crash when loading invalid/corrupt 
  cache or source-map files. Big thanks to @benhughes for providing the patch in GH-42

## 2.1.0

- Introduced SourceMap support

## 2.0.6

- Introduced a new option `cacheSignatureGenerator` to handle use cases such
  as [GH-35]

## 2.0.5

- Now using [mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp) for creating the 
  temp directory to support nested ones

## 2.0.4

- Fixed an issue where the cache was not being utilized on node v0.10 (since 
  `fs.statSync` doesn't exist with that name there) - thanks to [@XVincentX]

## 2.0.2

- Fixed an issue that was causing loaders running in foreground to not receive 
  the compiler options

## 2.0.1

- Package in NPM is now compact

## 2.0.0

- Pitching loader support
- More complete loader API support
- More convenient configuration interface

## 1.1.4

- Fixed an issue where the cache was being improperly invalidated due to 
  `cacheContext` not being stored properly (refs GH-17, thanks to @blowery)

## 1.1.3

- Fixed an issue where the initial cache was not being saved properly

## 1.1.2

- Fixed an issue on old node versions (0.10) with the EventEmitter API (GH-10)
- Fixed an issue that was breaking the compiler if an invalid `threads` option
  was passed (evaluating to `NaN`)

## 1.1.1

- Unrecognized and invalid config parameters will now cause the process to
  abort
- The active version is logged on launch

## 1.1.0

- Now supporting basic webpack loaders
- Dropped the `transformer` parameter as it's no longer needed
- `cache` now defaults to `true`
- Now using a forking model utilizing node.js's `process.fork()` for cleaner
  threading code

## 1.0.2

- Loader will now accept IDs that aren't just numbers
