# HappyPack (beta) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amireh/happypack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amireh/happypack) [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/amireh/happypack/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/amireh/happypack?branch=master)

_In a nutshell:_

HappyPack makes webpack builds faster by allowing you to transform multiple
files _in parallel_.

See "How it works" below for more details.

## Motivation

- webpack initial build times are horrifying in large codebases (3k+ modules)
- something that works against both a one-time build (e.g. for a CI) and
  continuous builds (i.e. `--watch` during development)

## Usage

```
npm install --save-dev happypack
```

In your `webpack.config.js`, you need to use the plugin and tell it of the
loaders it should use to transform the sources. ~~Note that you must specify
the absolute paths for these loaders as we do not use webpack's loader resolver
at this point.~~

```javascript
var HappyPack = require('happypack');

exports.plugins = [
  new HappyPack({
    // loaders is the only required parameter:
    loaders: [ 'babel?presets[]=es2015' ],

    // customize as needed, see Configuration below
  })
];
```

Now you replace your current loaders with HappyPack's loader (possibly use an
env variable to enable HappyPack):

```javascript
exports.module = {
  loaders: {
    test: /.js$/,
    loaders: [ 'happypack/loader' ],
    include: [
      // ...
    ],
  }
};
```

That's it. Now sources that match `.js$` will be handed off to happypack which
will transform them in parallel using the loaders you specified.

## Configuration

These are the parameters you can pass to the plugin when you instantiate it.

### `loaders: Array.<String|Object{path: String, query: String}>`

Each loader entry consists of the name or path of loader that would
transform the files and an optional query string to pass to it. This looks
similar to what you'd pass to webpack's `loader` config.

> **NOTE**
>
> HappyPack doesn't work with *all* webpack loaders as some loader API are not
> supported.
>
> See [this wiki page](https://github.com/amireh/happypack/wiki/Webpack-Loader-API-Support)
> for more details on current Loader API support.

It is possible to omit this value and have HappyPack automatically infer the
loaders it should use, see "Inferring loaders" below for more information

Defaults to: `null`

### `id: String`

A unique id for this happy plugin. This is used to generate the default cache
name and is used by the loader to know which plugin it's supposed to talk to.

Normally, you would not need to specify this unless you have more than one
HappyPack plugin defined, in which case you'll need distinct IDs to tell them
apart. See "Using multiple instances" below for more information on that.

Defaults to: "1"

### `enabled: Boolean`

Whether the plugin should be activated. This is for convenience when you want
to conditionally disable HappyPack based on, for example, an environment
variable.

Defaults to `true`

### `tempDir: String`

Path to a folder where happy's cache and junk files will be kept. It's safe to
remove this folder after a run but not during it!

Defaults to: `.happypack/`

### `cache: Boolean`

Whether HappyPack should re-use the compiled version of source files if their
contents have not changed since the last compilation time (assuming they have
been compiled, of course.)

Recommended!

Defaults to: `true`

### `cachePath: String`

Path to a file where the JSON cache will be saved to disk and read from on
successive webpack runs.

Defaults to `.happypack/cache--[id].json`

### `cacheContext: Object`

An object that is used to invalidate the cache between runs based on whatever
variables that might affect the transformation of your sources, like `NODE_ENV`
for example.

You should provide this if you perform different builds based on some external
parameters. **THIS OBJECT MUST BE JSON-SERIALIZABLE**.

E.g. 

```
cacheContext: {
  env: process.env.NODE_ENV
}
```

Defaults to: `{}`

### `cacheSignatureGenerator: Function`

A function that computes a signature for a file. This signature is used by
the cache to figure out whether the file contents have changed since the
last time it was compiled.

The function signature is:

    (filePath: String) -> String

Defaults to: a function that yields the `last-modified-at` (mtime) timestamp
of the given file.

### `threads: Number`

This number indicates how many Node VMs HappyPack will spawn for compiling
the source files. After a lot of tinkering, I found 4 to yield the best
results. There's certainly a diminishing return on this value and increasing
beyond 8 actually slowed things down for me.

Keep in mind that this is only relevant when performing **the initial build**
as HappyPack will switch into a synchronous mode afterwards (i.e. in `watch`
mode.) Also, if we're using the cache and the compiled versions are indeed
cached, the threads will be idle.

### `threadPool: HappyThreadPool`

A custom thread-pool to use for retrieving worker threads. Normally, this
is managed internally by each `HappyPlugin` instance, but you may override
this behavior for better results.

See "Shared thread pools" below for more information about this.

Defaults to: `null`

### `verbose: Boolean`

Enable this to log status messages from HappyPack to STDOUT like start-up
banner, cache status, etc..

Defaults to: `true`

### `verboseWhenProfiling: Boolean`

Enable this if you want happypack to still produce its output even when you're
doing a `webpack --profile` run. Since this variable was introduced, happypack
will be silent when doing a profile build in order not to corrupt any JSON
output by webpack (i.e. when using `--json` as well.)

Defaults to: `false`

### `debug: Boolean`

Enable this to log diagnostic messages from HappyPack to STDOUT. Useful for
troubleshooting.

Defaults to: `false`

## How it works

![A diagram showing the flow between HappyPack's components](doc/HappyPack_Workflow.png)

HappyPack sits between webpack and your primary source files (like JS sources)
where the bulk of loader transformations happen. Every time webpack resolves
a module, HappyPack will take it and all its dependencies, find out if they
need to be compiled[1], and if they do, it distributes those files to multiple
worker "threads".

Those threads are actually simple node processes that invoke your transformer.
When the compiled version is retrieved, HappyPack serves it to its loader and
eventually your chunk.

[1] When HappyPack successfully compiles a source file, it keeps track of its
mtime so that it can re-use it on successive builds if the contents have not
changed. This is a fast and somewhat reliable approach, and definitely much
faster than re-applying the transformers on every build.

## Inferring loaders

For configuration convenience, we can instruct a HappyPack plugin to use the
loaders specified in webpack's original `module.loaders` config by defining a
`happy: ...` option on that specific loader.

For example, the following config will cause HappyPack to work with the `babel`
loader against all `.js` source files:

```javascript
// @file: webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      loaders: [ 'babel' ],
      happy: { id: 'js' } // <-- see this
    }]
  },

  plugins: [
    new HappyPack({ id: 'js' }) // no need to specify loaders manually, yay!
  ]
}
```

> **Disclaimer**
>
> Using this method to configure loaders will cause HappyPack to **overwrite**
> webpack's loader options objects to replace the source loaders with happy's
> loader at run-time (ie, the config will be irreversibly mutated!).
>
> I did not find any way to work around this, so be warned!

## Using multiple instances

It's possible to define multiple HappyPack plugins for different types of
sources/transformations. Just pass in a unique id for each plugin and make
sure you pass it their loaders. For example:

```javascript
// @file webpack.config.js
exports.plugins = [
  new HappyPack({
    id: 'jsx',
    threads: 4,
    loaders: [ 'babel-loader' ]
  }),

  new HappyPack({
    id: 'coffeescripts',
    threads: 2,
    loaders: [ 'coffee-loader' ]
  })
];

exports.module.loaders = [
  {
    test: /\.js$/,
    loaders: [ 'happypack/loader?id=jsx' ]
  },

  {
    test: /\.coffee$/,
    loaders: [ 'happypack/loader?id=coffeescripts' ]
  },
]
```

Now `.js` files will be handled by the first Happy plugin which will use
`babel-loader` to transform them, while `.coffee` files will be handled
by the second one using the `coffee-loader` as a transformer.

Note that each plugin will properly use different cache files as the default
cache file names include the plugin IDs, so you don't need to override them
manually. Yay!

## Shared thread pools

Normally, each `HappyPlugin` instance you create internally manages its own
threads which are used to compile sources. However, if you have a number of
plugins, it can be more optimal to create a thread pool yourself and then
configure the instances to share that pool, minimizing the idle time of
threads within it.

Here's an example of using a custom pool of 5 threads that will be shared
between loaders for both JS and SCSS/LESS/whatever sources:

```javascript
// @file: webpack.config.js
var HappyPack = require('happypack');
var happyThreadPool = HappyPack.ThreadPool({ size: 5 });

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new HappyPack({
      id: 'js',
      threadPool: happyThreadPool
    }),

    new HappyPack({
      id: 'styles',
      threadPool: happyThreadPool
    })
  ]
};
```

## Benchmarks

For the main repository I tested on, which had around 3067 modules, the build time went down from 39 seconds to a whopping ~10 seconds when there was yet no
cache. Successive builds now take between 6 and 7 seconds.

Here's a rundown of the various states the build was performed in:

Elapsed (ms) | Happy?  | Cache enabled? | Cache present? | Using DLLs? |
------------ | ------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
39851        | NO      | N/A            | N/A            | NO          |
37393        | NO      | N/A            | N/A            | YES         |
14605        | YES     | NO             | N/A            | NO          |
13925        | YES     | YES            | NO             | NO          |
11877        | YES     | YES            | YES            | NO          |
9228         | YES     | NO             | N/A            | YES         |
9597         | YES     | YES            | NO             | YES         |
6975         | YES     | YES            | YES            | YES         |

The builds above were run under Linux on a machine with 12 cores.

## Changes

**staging (master)**

- HappyPack will no longer output anything to the console if webpack is running
  in profiling mode (`--profile`) in order not to corrupt any JSON output. You
  can restore the previous behavior by setting the new option
  `verboseWhenProfiling` to `true`. Refs GH-76

**2.2.1**

- Fixed an edge-case issue that was causing happypack to crash when a shared 
  threadpool is used by a pre-loader and a loader (or post-loader) that are 
  processing the same file. Refs GH-60
- Made it possible to completely silence happypack's console output by setting
  verbose to `false` and introduced the `debug` option to control diagnostic
  message logging. Refs GH-64

**2.2.0**

- Fixed a regression in scanning loader "string chains" (multiple loaders 
  specified in the same string separated by `!`), refs GH-68
- Added support for the loader API `this.loadModule()` which is used by
  less-loader, refs GH-66

**2.1.3**

- Fixed an issue where certain loader configurations with queries weren't being
  properly recognized by HappyPack. Now, all known configuration variants 
  should work. (GH-65 and GH-26)

**2.1.2**

- Process argv will no longer be passed to the child processes spawned by 
  HappyPack (refs GH-47)
- Support for the `target` loader context variable has been added. Thanks to 
  @Akkuma (refs GH-46)

**2.1.1**

- Fixed an issue where happypack would crash when loading invalid/corrupt 
  cache or source-map files. Big thanks to @benhughes for providing the patch in GH-42

**2.1.0**

- Introduced SourceMap support

**2.0.6**

- Introduced a new option `cacheSignatureGenerator` to handle use cases such
  as [GH-35]

**2.0.5**

- Now using [mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp) for creating the 
  temp directory to support nested ones

**2.0.4**

- Fixed an issue where the cache was not being utilized on node v0.10 (since 
  `fs.statSync` doesn't exist with that name there) - thanks to [@XVincentX]

**2.0.2**

- Fixed an issue that was causing loaders running in foreground to not receive 
  the compiler options

**2.0.1**

- Package in NPM is now compact

**2.0.0**

- Pitching loader support
- More complete loader API support
- More convenient configuration interface

**1.1.4**

- Fixed an issue where the cache was being improperly invalidated due to 
  `cacheContext` not being stored properly (refs GH-17, thanks to @blowery)

**1.1.3**

- Fixed an issue where the initial cache was not being saved properly

**1.1.2**

- Fixed an issue on old node versions (0.10) with the EventEmitter API (GH-10)
- Fixed an issue that was breaking the compiler if an invalid `threads` option
  was passed (evaluating to `NaN`)

**1.1.1**

- Unrecognized and invalid config parameters will now cause the process to
  abort
- The active version is logged on launch

**1.1.0**

- Now supporting basic webpack loaders
- Dropped the `transformer` parameter as it's no longer needed
- `cache` now defaults to `true`
- Now using a forking model utilizing node.js's `process.fork()` for cleaner
  threading code

**1.0.2**

- Loader will now accept IDs that aren't just numbers
